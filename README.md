## Quick Color Samples

The goal of this project is to practice shell scripting and create something useful.
I was always Googling the conversion between HEX and rgb so now I can do it from the terminal, which I always have open anyways.

### Installation

Put the script in .local/bin and presto you can call it from anywhere.
